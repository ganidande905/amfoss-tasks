## For part 4
I've combined the all codes received into a single txt file and decoded this using 
base64 -d<<<'<combined code here>'
ive recieved a link which navigated me to a repo 

## For part 5
I've cloned this repo and went through the commits using git log
but that didn't get me anywhere so I used git diff <commit-id> <commit-id>
I used this to get the difference between both commits for everything
but when comparing the last second commit to the last commit I again found a code
which i decoded to find a repo

#Finally
Ive cloned this repo
and tried to run the code in the terimnal but faced an issue
I dont know why but my github was looged out so I had to log in again and 
then I got the final message
