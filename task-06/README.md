# React

## Overview
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, primarily for single-page applications. It allows developers to create large web applications that can update and render efficiently with minimal coding. React is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies.

## Prerequisites
To work with React, you should have:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Node.js**:
    Download and install Node.js from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Create a new React application using Create React App**:
    ```bash
    npx create-react-app my-app
    cd my-app
    ```

3. **Start the development server**:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    This will run the app in development mode and open it in your browser.

4. **Build the project for production**:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    This command bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

## Usage
React can be used to create both simple components and complex user interfaces. The basic building blocks of a React application are components, which can be defined as JavaScript functions or classes.
