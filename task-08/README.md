### Okay so like I made this Telegram bot right And surprisingly it was actually kinda fun Yeah I know I wasn’t expecting it either Usually coding is just me struggling and googling everything but this time I did most of it on my own and it felt pretty cool

### Meet PagePal My New Bot Buddy

So the bot I made is called PagePal It’s like your personal book buddy You just tell it a genre and it sends you a list of books in a CSV file with all the details Like titles authors links the whole package It’s pretty neat if I do say so myself And the best part was I didn’t need to rely on AI tools much this time I actually understood what I was doing for once

Building PagePal was different from my usual coding stuff Normally I’m just copying code from the internet and hoping it works But this time I really got into it The Telegram API docs were actually understandable for once and I could focus on adding cool stuff like the /book command It was fun seeing it all come together and actually work without too much hassle

### Why This Wasn’t a Total Mess

So usually when I code it’s like herding cats I think I know what I’m doing but really I’m just chasing bugs and trying not to break everything But with PagePal it was different This time I didn’t just copy-paste stuff I actually built things myself And it felt good Every time I added a new feature like the /preview command that gives you a link to check out a book it was like a tiny win

The /reading_list command was probably the coolest It lets you add delete and view your reading list in a DOCX file And yeah I broke things a few times but figuring it out myself made it feel even better Like hey maybe I can actually do this coding thing after all

### The Takeaway Going Solo Is Kinda Cool Sometimes

What really made this fun was that I did most of it on my own No AI no endless googling Just me and my code And that made it more enjoyable I remembered why I started coding in the first place because it can actually be fun when you’re not just relying on tools to do all the work for you

So yeah if you’re into coding and want to try something new building a Telegram bot is actually pretty cool You might even have a good time like I did who knew right
