### I wasn't able to complete the task
### I left it half way
### I couldn't completely understand the task but I started doing it
### I faced many issues in the sytax and api calls
### In the end I realised that I've been too dependent on AI tools rather than doing the task myself
### doing all the tasks perfectly iin the given time while managing my personal life and my internship was a bit hectic
### but I've managed to do most of the tasks to near perfection using the help of Google and other similar project repos and a bit of AI tools
### The important point is that not jsut refering or copy psating code but ive understood the code completely and am confident that i can do the tasks on these languages without the help of AI tools.
